Requires at least: Wordpress 3.3 Buddypress 2.0
Tested up to: Wordpress 4.3 Buddypress 2.3.3



This plugin will restrict registration for Buddypress installation.
Only users that reveive an invitation will be able to registre to the site.

It will create a new table in database whit the email to invite, the invitation date and a field to take control
of users that have registrered to the site after invitation, so maybe administrator can delete these records, as tese users will be in the Wordpress Users list.


When a user register to the site no more steps will be required and his account will be activated. No activation mail will be sent.

Administrator will be able to customize email subject and content from the back-end.
